They utilize the same C-- libraries as HTCondor itself, meaning they have nearly the same behavior as the command line tools.\n\nHere, you will learn the basics of the python bindings and how to use them.  This tutorial is broken down into two major sections:\n\n- **Introduction**, a quick overview of the major components.  Each learning module is meant to be done in sequence.  Start here if you have never used the bindings before.\n- **Advanced**, an in-depth examination of the nooks and crannies of the system.  Each module is standalone; read only those that look interesting to you.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n1.  [ClassAds Introduction](introductory/ClassAds-Introduction.ipynb).
